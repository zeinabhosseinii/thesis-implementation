This repository contains the implementation of **Extended Rebeca Dependency Graph (ERDG)** for dependency-guided test generation of Rebeca actor models.  
The project provides a complete pipeline including grammar specification, abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis, ERDG construction, actor/message dependency detection, and systematic generation of prioritized test cases.

## ðŸš€ Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/thesis-implementation.git
   cd thesis-implementation
Run the main script:
python -m src.main
Inspect the outputs:
Graphical outputs (in .png format) are stored in the outputs/images/ folder:
AST.png â€“ Abstract Syntax Tree of the input model
ERDG.png â€“ Extended Rebeca Dependency Graph
AG.png â€“ Actor Dependency Graph
HAG.png â€“ Hierarchical Actor Group Graph
The file outputs/generated_test_cases.txt contains all generated prioritized test cases with assigned actor and method priorities.
